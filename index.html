<!--    NOTES
    - HTML boiler plate
    - Most HTML files consist of a Head and a Body (<head>, <body>)
    - Meta elements give extra meta data or associate data to the html element
    - "charset=UTF-8" means that all the characters in the html elements are encoded with the UTF-8 character set
    - Mojibake means characters without a form, happens when your html characters are 
    encoded with the wrong character set
    - Different encoding for different languages, since characters vary b/w languages
    - Meta elements also provide information about the website to the browser (description, author, keywords, etc)
    - Keep indents consistent to help programmers read code more easily
    - to italicize in HTML, use "<em>" rather than "<i>". "i" only styles the text, while "em" emphasizes the text.
        visually, the outcome is the same.
    - Similar relationship between "<bold>" and "<strong>"
    - "<hr />" is used to for a Horizontal Rule
