- Commonly used in tandum with HTML files
- We are able to inject CSS right into the HTML tags (Usually the body tag)

- to know which css property to use, go to MDN. [background-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color)

NOTES (Sec 4, Lec 32)

- In the previous notes, we styled the background of the webpage by injecting css code to the body element of the HTML file
  using the "style=" attribute
- To add style to the whole webpage, we can add a <style></style> tag within the <head> tag of the html file
- No webpage is unstyled, each webpage is rendered with a default css styling applied to it.
- When working with sizing of HTML elements, its important to be cautious when working with fixed heights and widths because it
  will effect the responsiveness of the webpage when the browser changes size.
- Be sure to view the [syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#syntax) of new attributes to understand its full functionality.
- how can we create external CSS to style all our HTML files
