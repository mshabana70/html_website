<!--    NOTES (lec 14-15)
    - HTML boiler plate
    - Most HTML files consist of a Head and a Body (<head>, <body>)
    - Meta elements give extra meta data or associate data to the html element
    - "charset=UTF-8" means that all the characters in the html elements are encoded with the UTF-8 character set
    - Mojibake means characters without a form, happens when your html characters are 
    encoded with the wrong character set
    - Different encoding for different languages, since characters vary b/w languages
    - Meta elements also provide information about the website to the browser (description, author, keywords, etc)
    - Keep indents consistent to help programmers read code more easily
    - to italicize in HTML, use "<em>" rather than "<i>". "i" only styles the text, while "em" emphasizes the text.
        visually, the outcome is the same.
    - Similar relationship between "<bold>" and "<strong>"
    - "<hr />" is used to for a Horizontal Rule or line that stretches across the webpage

<!--    NOTES (Lec 16-17)
    - Creating lists in HTML
    - "<ul>" is used for listing in HTML. It is an Unordered List.
    - "<ol>" is used for listing in HTML. It is an Ordered List.
    - "<ol>" can be customized using the "type" attribute, or even the "start" attribute
    - "<img>" is an element used to import images to your webpage. "alt" attribute is used to substitute text when 
    image does not load.

<!--    NOTES (Lec 18)
    - Hyperlinks are an element that allow users to be redirected to another webpage
    - "<a>" is the HTML anchor element which (when used with "href" attribute) creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations, etc.
    - "href" is assigned the destination URL
    - "<a>" anchor element requires a close tag.
    - In this exercise, I use href to redirect to a seperate HTML file for my hobbies list and contact information

<!--   NOTES (SEC 3, Lect 20)
    - "<table>" element in HTML represents tabular data - that is,
      information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of 
      rows and columns of cells containing data.
    - "<thead>" element used to specify table headers but also isolate sections of the table. 
      This allows for better styling capabilities, allowing us to style the table header and table body (<tbody>) individually.
    - using thead, tbody, and tfoot is good practice as it will help with CSS implementation in the future.

<!--   NOTES (Lect 21, "Using tables for layout")
    - "<table>" element in HTML represents tabular data - that is,
      information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of 
      rows and columns of cells containing data.
    - We use tables for layout of HTML elements, this is a way of styling a webpage using only HTML, as opposed to CSS
    - To space out columns in a row, use the "cellspacing" attribute for the "<table>" element

<!--   NOTES (Lect 22, HTML table code challenge)
